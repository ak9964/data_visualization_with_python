2. a Defined as a function F as Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. Write a Python program which accepts a value for N (where N >0) as input and pass this value to the function. 
Display suitable error message if the condition for input value is not followed.

def Fibonacci(n):
if n<= 0:
  print("Incorrect input, Please enter a positive integer")
# First Fibonacci number is 0
elif n == 1:
  return 0
# Second Fibonacci number is 1
elif n == 2:
  return 1
else:
  return Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2)
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
print(Fibonacci(n))
