3b. Write a Python program to find the string similarity between two given strings.
Sample Output: Original string: Python Exercises Python Exercises Similarity
between two said strings: 1.0 Sample Output: Original string: Python Exercises
Python Exercise Similarity between two said strings: 0.967741935483871

from difflib import SequenceMatcher
string1 = "Python Exercises"
string2 = "Python Exercise"
similarity = SequenceMatcher(None, string1, string2).ratio()
print("Original string:")
print(string1)
print(string2)
print("Similarity between two said strings:")
print(similarity)
